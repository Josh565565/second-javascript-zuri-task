# second-javascript-zuri-task
This is my second Zuri JavaScript task.
I created a simple prompt calculator.
The calculator can perform simple operations such as Addition, Subscraction, Division and Multiplication.
When you run the calculator, you will be asked to choose either Addition, Subscraction, Division or Multiplication (+, -, /, *). 
When you select your choice
You will be asked to enter your first number then your second number then click ok to get your answer.
When you enter a wrong input, you will be asked to refresh the page and try again.
